# No Helmet
**Author:** Cloud a.k.a Comethruuu  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Description
A simple script that **automatically removes the helmet** whenever a player spawns on an ESX-based server. This script also ensures the player job data (`job`) is properly loaded before use.

## Notes
- This script only works for player characters (not NPCs).
- It does not disable bike or vehicle helmets automatically, only removes helmets on spawn.

## Installation
1. Place this script folder into your FiveM server’s `resources/[local]/` directory.
2. Add the following line to your `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure cloud-nohelmet
   ```
